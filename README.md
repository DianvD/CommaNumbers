# CommaNumbers
Impact Take Home test

 This is a program to implement an interface to produce a comma delimited list of numbers, grouping the numbers into a range when they are sequential.

 Assumptions:
 I assume that there will be no duplicate values.
 I assume that the list must be sorted before execution (meaning if list was 34,33,32 it will count as being sequential).

 Additional Notes:
 Run the program.
 Enter a number and press "Enter".
 To stop entering numbers and continue the program, add 0 as your number (when requested) and press "Enter".
